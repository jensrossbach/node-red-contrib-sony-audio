![node-red-contrib-sony-audio](images/sony_audio_flow.png)

With these nodes you can connect to your Sony audio devices and send control commands (like powering on/off, change volume etc.), retrieve information (like the current volume, the current value of a sound setting etc.) or get notified of certain events (like a change of the power state, a change of the mute state etc.).
