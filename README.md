# node-red-contrib-sony-audio
A collection of Node-RED nodes to control Sony audio devices via the Sony Audio Control API.

With these nodes you can connect to your Sony audio devices and send control commands (like powering on/off, change volume etc.), retrieve information (like the current volume, the current value of a sound setting etc.) or get notified of certain events (like a change of the power state, a change of the mute state etc.).

If you would like to propose a new feature or any kind of improvement or if you want to report a bug, don't hesitate to create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-sony-audio/issues) of the repository on GitHub.

## Documentation
This package is the successor of the [node-red-contrib-sony-audio-control](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-sony-audio-control) node collection. It contains new powerful flow nodes providing the same and more functionality and flexibility as the old package.

The node collection consists of two flow nodes and one configuration node. The configuration node stores the network address of your Sony audio device. You have to specify a host name (or IP address) and the port (by default, port 10000 is used).

### Controller Node
Node for controlling a Sony audio device via the Audio Control API. The node sends requests to a Sony audio device and provides the returned result. The details of the request can be set via the node's configuration page. All settings (except the filters) can also be programmatically overridden, see input description below.

![Controller Node](images/controller_node.png)

The node also supports a low-level mode for cases where the built-in commands are not sufficient. Via specific attributes (see input description below), any request supported by the Sony Audio Control API can be sent to the device. See Sony <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/api-references/api-overview-2">Audio Control API</a> reference for more details about the API methods and their parameters.

#### Configuration
On the configuration page, you can configure various settings of the node. Optionally enter a name to be displayed - if omitted, "control: _command_" will be shown as name. Next you must select the Sony audio device to talk to. The following three checkboxes control which outputs will be provided by the node. The _Filters_ checkbox enables or disables the group of filter output ports, the _Response_ checkbox enables or disables the response output port and the _Error_ checkbox enables or disables the error output port. See chapter [Outputs](#outputs) below for more information.

#### Input
The input message is used to trigger and programmatically configure the controller node. Depending on the provided attributes, either the node's configuration can be overridden or a low-level request can be sent to the Audio Control API.

##### Configuration Overriding
By providing any of the following attributes in the input message, the corresponding settings from the node configuration are overridden.

```javascript
{
    "command": "string",  // overrides selected command
    "payload":
    {
        "source":
        {
            "scheme":   "string",  // overrides selected source
            "resource": "string",  //   -||-
            "port":     "number"   // overrides port number
        },
        "volume":
        {
            "absolute": "number",  // overrides volume ('Relative Volume' unchecked)
            "relative": "number"   // overrides volume ('Relative Volume' checked)
        },
        "settings":  // overrides list of sound or playback mode settings
        [
            {
                "target": "string",  // overrides selected type of sound or playback mode setting
                "value":  "string"   // overrides selected sound or playback mode setting value
            }
        ],
        "target": "string",  // overrides selected sound or playback mode setting to retrieve
        "zone":   "number"   // overrides zone number (0 correponds to 'All Zones' checked)
    }
}
```

Only certain combinations are meaningful, see the following table.

|Command|source|volume|settings|target|zone|
|-------|:----:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:--:|

|scanBackward| | | | |X|
|scanForward| | | | |X|

For details to the input message attributes, please also check the [Filters](#filters-2) chapter further down.

##### Low-Level Request
To send a low-level request to the Audio Control API, i.e. a request which is directly understood by the device, the following attributes according to the Sony Audio Control API specification are required in the input message.

```javascript
{
    "service": "string",  // the API service of the request
    "method":  "string",  // the API method of the request
    "version": "string",  // the API version of the request
    "payload":
    {
        ...  // the parameters of the request
    }
}
```

For more information on how to form a request, please refer to the Sony [Audio Control API](https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/api-references/api-overview-2) reference. There is no need to encapsulate the payload into an array, this is automatically done by the node. For methods that do not have parameters, the `msg.payload` must be set to `null`.

#### Outputs
The node provides a variable number of output ports depending on the configuration. There are two output ports for the raw response and error information as well as a variable number of outputs depending on the filter configuration.

##### Filters
If enabled, the filter output ports provide filtered result data according to the configured filters. The number of filter output ports is determined by the number of filters whereat each filter gets a dedicated output assigned. When there is a response from the device arriving and a filter matches (i.e. it can handle the method of the request), it will process the response and send a message with filtered data on its dedicated output. If multiple filters match the response, there will be multiple output messages sent. The filtered data is contained in the `msg.payload` of the output messages, see [Filters](#filters-2) chapter for a description of the message format.

##### Response
If enabled, the response output port provides the raw / low-level response as sent by the Audio Control API in case the node's operation succeeded. The message has the following format:

```javascript
{
    "service": "string",  // the API service of the request
    "method":  "string",  // the API method of the request
    "version": "string",  // the API version of the request
    "payload":
    {
        ...  // the result data of the request
    }
}
```

##### Error
If enabled, the error output port provides error information in case the node's operation failed for whatever reason. The message has the following format:

```javascript
{
    "service": "string",  // the API service of the request
    "method":  "string",  // the API method of the request
    "version": "string",  // the API version of the request
    "payload":
    {
        "error":   "number",  // the error code
        "details": "string"   // human readable details of the error
    }
}
```

Most [error codes](https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/api-references/error-codes) are specified by the Audio Control API, however some custom node specific error codes have been additionally defined:

|Error Code|Description                      |
|----------|---------------------------------|
|32768     |Invalid node input               |
|32769     |Invalid command                  |
|32770     |Communication or processing error|

### Receiver Node
Notifies an event from a Sony audio device via the Sony Audio Control API. The node listens for notifications and provides the event data upon reception. The service to listen to can be set via the node's configuration page.

![Receiver Node](images/receiver_node.png)

#### Configuration
On the configuration page, you can configure various settings of the node. Optionally enter a name to be displayed - if omitted, "receiver: _service_" will be shown as name. Next you must select the Sony audio device to listen to. The following two checkboxes control which outputs will be provided by the node. The _Filters_ checkbox enables or disables the group of filter output ports and the _Event_ checkbox enables or disables the event output port. See chapter [Outputs](#outputs-1) below for more information.

![General Settings](images/receiver_settings1.png)

The next dropdown box selects the service to bind to. Depending on the selected service, different checkboxes for the available events appear. Each checkbox allows to subscribe to the corresponding notification.

![Service & Notification Settings](images/receiver_settings2.png)

If the filter output ports are enabled, filters for post processing the notification from the device can be configured in the last section. See [Filters](#filters-2) chapter for more information on how to setup the filters.

#### Input
The node has no input ports.

#### Outputs
The node provides a variable number of output ports depending on the configuration. There is one output ports for the raw event data as well as a variable number of outputs depending on the filter configuration.

##### Filters
If enabled, the filter output ports provide filtered result data according to the configured filters. The number of filter output ports is determined by the number of filters whereat each filter gets a dedicated output assigned. When there is an event from the device arriving and a filter matches (i.e. it can handle the method of the notification), it will process the event and send a message with filtered data on its dedicated output. If multiple filters match the event, there will be multiple output messages sent. The filtered data is contained in the `msg.payload` of the output messages, see [Filters](#filters-2) chapter for a description of the message format.

##### Event
If enabled, the event output port provides the raw / low-level event data as sent by the Audio Control API upon notification. The message has the following format:

```javascript
{
    "service": "string",  // the API service of the event
    "method":  "string",  // the API method of the event
    "version": "string",  // the API version of the event
    "payload":
    {
        ...  // the event data
    }
}
```

### Filters
The filters are configured by a list which can be extended or reduced as needed. Use the button under the list to add new filters, use the 'x' button on the right side of each filter to delete it or drag the filter rows to reorder the list. Each filter gets a dedicated output assigned which is indicated on the right side of the filter. Via the dropdown box, you can select the filter, some filters have further selection possibilities. The following filters are supported.

![Filter Settings](images/filter_settings.png)

> ##### Powered
> Results in `true` or `false` of the `msg.payload` depending on wether the device is powered on or not. If _Explicit_ is checked, a message is sent only if the result is `true`.
>
> ##### Standby
> Results in `true` or `false` of the `msg.payload` depending on wether the device is in standby mode or not. If _Explicit_ is checked, a message is sent only if the result is `true`.
>
> ##### Software Update
> Results in `true` or `false` of the `msg.payload` depending on wether a software update is available for the device or not. If _Explicit_ is checked, a message is sent only if the result is `true`.
>
> ##### Source
> Extracts the source from the response. The `msg.payload` is an object with the following format:
> ```javascript
> {
>     "scheme":   "string",  // the source's scheme
>     "resource": "string",  // the source's resource
>     "port":     "number"   // the port in case of an HDMI source
> }
> ```
> The following combinations are possible:
