    <p>
        Notifies an event from a Sony audio device via the Sony Audio Control API.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node listens for notifications and provides the event data.
    </p>
    <p>
        See Sony <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/api-references/api-overview-2">Audio Control API</a>
        reference for more details about the notification methods and their parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        Please choose the service for the events you want to get notified and
        select one or more corresponding notifications to subscribe for.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use filters to filter the event data by certain criteria. Add,
        remove or reorder filters and select the type of filter. The number on
        the right side shows the number of the output to which the result of
        the filter will be sent.
    <p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        The node provides a variable number of outputs which can be selected via
        the configuration page. By default, only the <i>Filter</i> outputs are
        active.
    </p>
    <ol class="node-ports">
        <li>Filters
            <p>
                Each configured filter provides a dedicated output port to
                which its filtered data is sent.
            </p>
            <dl class="message-properties">
                <dt>payload<span class="property-type">boolean | number | string | object</span></dt>
                <dd>
                    Contains the filtered data of the received notification.
                    Messages are only sent on these ports if the event data is
                    applicable to any of the filters.
                </dd>
            </dl>

                Control API.
